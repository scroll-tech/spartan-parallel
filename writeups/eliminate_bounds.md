# Eliminate the Number of Bounds on Proofs and Memory Accesses

## Motivation
Data-parallelism is extremely useful and efficient, as it allows the prover and verifier to use one copy of the instance to verify the correctness of unbounded number of witnesses, reducing time for polynomial commitment and opening in the process. However,
